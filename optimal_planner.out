usage: 
./src/search/downward-1 [OPTIONS] --search SEARCH < OUTPUT

* SEARCH (SearchEngine): configuration of the search algorithm
* OUTPUT (filename): preprocessor output

Options:
--help [NAME]
    Prints help for all heuristics, openlists, etc. called NAME.
    Without parameter: prints help for everything available
--landmarks LANDMARKS_PREDEFINITION
    Predefines a set of landmarks that can afterwards be referenced
    by the name that is specified in the definition.
--heuristic HEURISTIC_PREDEFINITION
    Predefines a heuristic that can afterwards be referenced
    by the name that is specified in the definition.
--random-seed SEED
    Use random seed SEED

--plan-file FILENAME
    Plan will be output to a file called FILENAME
